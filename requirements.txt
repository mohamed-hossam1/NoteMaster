PyQt5==5.15.9
bcrypt==4.0.1
PyAudio==0.2.13

# Note: PyAudio can sometimes be tricky to install.
# On Linux, you may need: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-dev
# On macOS (Homebrew): brew install portaudio
# On Windows, downloading a pre-compiled wheel from a site like
# Christoph Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
# might be necessary if pip install fails, or use pipwin:
# pip install pipwin
# pipwin install pyaudio
#
# Always prefer using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your activated
# virtual environment after installing all dependencies to get exact versions.
